# Image-to-Ascii
A python script that transforms an image into ASCII art.

## Usage:
This project is powered by Pillow so first thing you need to do is to install Pillow using:

```
$ pip install Pillow
```
To use the script write the following command in your terminal:
```
$ python3 img-to-ascii.py imagepath
```

### Example:
```
$ python3 img-to-ascii.py picture.jpeg
```

The script will create a file called "picture.txt" in the path of the script. After running the command in terminal you can find the ASCII art version of your photo in that file.
